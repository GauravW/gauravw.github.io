## About me

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)’s [Cahill Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/). My interests include building space hardware and instrumentation, and studying rapidly fading relativistic transients. 

At the [Space Radiation Lab](https://www.srl.caltech.edu/), I am developing next-generation X-ray detectors for future space missions. At [Caltech Optical Observatories](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/research/coo/), I am building the next-generation infrared telescope [Cryoscope](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137f5001K/abstract), to be deployed at Antarctica. I also develop sensitive pipelines for rapid identification of transients like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in data from NuSTAR ([SINGS](https://nustarsoc.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/grbs/)) and AstroSat-CZTI ([CIFT](https://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=grb)).

I am also a [Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS)](https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/) affiliate for the 2026 cohort, engaging in interdisciplinary space science and technology.

I am originally from Nagpur, also known as the Orange City, in the central part of India. I spent a decade in Mumbai during my studies at IIT Bombay, before moving to California in 2025.

## Previous experience

Previously, I did my B.Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) and Ph.D. (Astrophysics) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). 

My Ph.D. was supervised by [Varun Bhalerao](https://www.star-iitb.in/group/varun-bhalerao) at [STAR Lab](https://www.star-iitb.in/). During my Ph.D., I led the structural and thermal design of the proposed [Daksha](https://www.dakshasat.in/) satellite mission, studied high-energy transients with [AstroSat](https://www.isro.gov.in/AstroSat.html)-CZTI, and worked on low-latency gravitational-wave alerts with the [LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA](https://www.ligo.org/) collaboration. Earlier, as a B.Tech. student in Mechanical Engineering, I worked on astronomy projects across the electromagnetic spectrum (X-ray, optical, and radio), was part of the [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/) team, building the gearbox & cooling of an electric race car, and was a part of [Krittika](https://www.instagram.com/krittika.iitb/).
